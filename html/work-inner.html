    <p>Project Brief</p>
    <p>
        The task was to build or rebrand ingletech’s  
        website that showed off their exquisite collection of 
         in a way that not only captivates the consumer but draws them 
         in. It was a big one! We were asked to help re-establish an online presence which was lost. 
         We led the design work, as well as helped them find a new development 
         partner that could meet their ongoing needs as well as a new design approach. 
         Eventually, our relationship developed into us becoming brand guardians.
            <br>
            For one, we can’t quite say this is a case study because 
            it’ll be more storyish, or reiteration of best practices and 
            methods applied throughout our development process. 
            Welcome to our case study! Our task was set. 
            It’s our turn to accomplish it and overdo just a little.
